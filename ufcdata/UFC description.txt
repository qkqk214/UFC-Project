이 데이터는 UFC 전적 데이터입니다. 모든 행은 양쪽 파이터들의 정보, 경기에 대한 정보, 승자에 대한 정보를 포함하고 있습니다. 데이터는 UFCSTATS 웹사이트에서 크롤링 해왔습니다.
경기 후 많은 정보가 이 웹사이트에 있는 것을 보았고 beautifulsoup를 활용하여 크롤링하고 pandas를 이용하여 처리하였습니다. 이것은 매우 길고 어려운 작업이었기에 실수가 있을 수 있습니다.

Each row is a compilation of both fighter stats. Fighters are represented by 'red' and 'blue' (for red and blue corner). 
So for instance, red fighter has the complied average stats of all the fights except the current one. 
The stats include damage done by the red fighter on the opponent and the damage done by the opponent on the fighter (represented by 'opp' in the columns) in all the fights this particular red fighter has had, 
except this one as it has not occured yet (in the data). Same information exists for blue fighter. 
The target variable is 'Winner' which is the only column that tells you what happened. Here are some column definitions:
